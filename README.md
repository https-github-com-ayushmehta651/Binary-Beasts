# BinaryBeastHackman5.0

This is a solution to the problem statemnent focuse during the HackmanV5.0
The problem statement was "To provide a platform to donar of the remaining food and the organizations which are available in the society for the uniform distribution of the food, but there is absence of platform for the people to compare multiple organization on a single place."
We came up with the website/platform call "Food Donation" where the organization will be listed already at a single place and the donor have choice to choose with which organization they want to move ahead.
***

## Functionality currently available to this platform:
Currently the website is capable to provide the basic details of the organization which are operating in different districts of Karnataka(31 districts). And it provides an eye suiting interface with which the comfortable level of comparison by the donor can be made while selecting for an organization.
